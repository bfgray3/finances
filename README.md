## finances

this is an in-progress tool to track my personal finances.

## usage

`main.py`:

```
usage: main.py [-h] [--csv CSV] [--names NAMES]

options:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --csv CSV
  --names NAMES
```

in the working directory there should be two files:
    * a csv...
    * a json file with the names of which columns are assets and which are liabilities
